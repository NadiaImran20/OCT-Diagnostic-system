# OCT-Diagnostic-system
This project leverages deep learning and transfer learning to classify retinal diseases from OCT images into four categories (CNV, DME, DRUSEN, NORMAL). Using a two-phase training strategy, it achieves robust performance, and a Gradio interface enables clinicians to obtain real-time diagnostic predictions.
